I am **Qifei Li**, a master student graduated from Beihang University. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Sino-French Engineering School](http://ecpkn.buaa.edu.cn/), Beihang University.

I am a member of the National Laboratory of Software Development Environment (NLSDE) and advised by Professor [Ke Xu](http://sites.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/). I am currently a research intern at [NLC Group @ Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-computing/) and advised Doctor Tao Ge. I've also visited [MILA](https://mila.quebec/) and [USC](https://www.isi.edu/) where I was fortunate to work with [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/) and [Xiang Ren](http://ink-ron.usc.edu/xiangren/) respectively. Please check my [CV](/files/CV-chunshu.pdf) for further information.

**I will apply for Ph.D. in NLP, Deep Learning, and related areas starting from Fall 2021. Feel free to drop me a line if interested!**

Research
======
My primary research goal is to apply Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing and develop **Language Technology for All**. To achievethis goal and make language technology accessible in most people’s lives, I identify two major research topics that I’m interested in: **efficiency** and **trustworthiness** of NLP models. Efficiency involves both the amount of **computation** and **data** required for (pre-)training and using NLP models. Trustworthiness involves the **interpretability**, **fairness**, and **robustness** with respect to adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution samples.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Natural language generation, creative text generation, evaluation for NLG models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Commonsense reasoning and knowledge-based reasoning.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Robust NLP models for OOD samples and reducing spurious dataset biases.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Interpretability, explainability, biases, and fairness for NLP models.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Green NLP, Low resource NLP, and Learning NLP models from high-level supervision**  
I am open to academic collaborations and please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.
